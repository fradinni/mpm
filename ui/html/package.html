			<h1>Wildcaves 3 - Minecraft 1.4.6/1.4.7</h1>
			<p align="justify">This mod gives some much needed love to vanilla caves, adds stalactites, stalagmites, vines, glowing mushrooms, icicles and there's more to come.</p>
			<p align="justify">This mod is based off greyjusticar's mod which was based on Dilla's mod, hence the 3. This mod is a complete rewrite, all code is mine but I'm using the same sprites plus some new ones i made.</p>
			<p align="justify">This is an alpha version, I'm hoping to get some feedback and new ideas from this but I'll be adding more content and fixing more bugs before i consider it ready for release.</p>
			<p align="justify">
				<b>A note on the configs:</b><br>
				I've set the default config to be pretty low so it won't impact much your FPS while generating new chunks, i encourage you to mess around with the configs untill you find the balance you like but beware that the higher you set the "times per chunck" option the bigger the impact on your fps when exploring new areas.
				<br><br>
				<b>Suggestions and ideas:</b><br>
				If you have any suggestions or ideas for things that would fit well in this mod or things that i should change, please post them here, I'm always looking for new inspiration.
